# Akop's Homebrew Tap

I'm using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to manage all installed software on both Linux and macOS machines.  
You can check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/akopdev/dotfiles) to find an up-to-date list of the software I use.

This repository is my personal Homebrew tap, housing formulas for all my projects.

## Install

```sh

# Enable this tap
brew tab akopdev/formulas

```
